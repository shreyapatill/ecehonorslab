Project Proposal Guideline
Introduction



Statement of Purpose

Please provide a brief description of your project. List the goals and objectives of your project and explain why this project is useful for the problem your group wants to solve or functions that make your project unique. 
The goal of our project is to construct and program a machine that can autonomously solve a Rubik’s Cube puzzle, starting from any random combination. 

Background Research

Please provide details on the background research your group has done for your project. Explain what drives you to work on this project and/or why this project is important.
We are working on this project because we thought it would be cool to create something that could solve the complicated puzzle that is the Rubik’s Cube. We looked into what people have used to build a Rubik’s cube solver and modified their designs to build our project.
Also include discussions on any similar projects your group have looked at in coming up with your project. How is your proposed project different or similar to those your group have looked at.
This project is similar to the Rubik’s Cube Solver back in Spring 2020. However, we plan to make the mechanical frame out of legos or 3d printing to cut down on cost and need for mechanical design experience. We also plan to use two cameras to scan the faces of the cube. 


Design Details



Block Diagram / Flow Chart

Provide a simple block diagram of your hardware design. A block diagram is a schematic graphic that shows the interactions between different components in a hardware or software system. If appropriate, please also include a flow chart showing the steps your design needs to go through to function. The online program draw.io is a great tool to create polished block diagrams and flowcharts. Likewise Microsoft's visio is also a great program to create block diagrams and flowcharts.



System Overview

Provide descriptions to your block diagram and flow chart. State the purpose of each block. 
Rubik’s Cube: Would be a shame if this were missing...
UI: Where a human can input the colors of the faces. This is the input of the machine.
Each color has a number, you run a python code that allows you to type in the numbers that represent the cube
Data is sent to the Raspberry Pi by USB wire
IR Sensor: Senses whether the cube is in position and ready to be solved
Raspberry Pi: The brains. Figures out the status of the cube, calculates the solution, and sends the moves to the motors
Motor Drivers: The interface between the motor and the Pi
Stepper Motors: Rotates the faces of the cube to solve it
