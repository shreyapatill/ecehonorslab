; This is a program by Aryan Gupta, made on November 13,2020
; The purpose of this program is to add all the postive numbers
; in a list of 10 numbers in the numbers.bin file
; This function will check through the 10 numbers and only 
; add the postiive numbers.
; We will initialize R3 at x3131 instead of x3132, but
; that is intentional due to the design of my program
; we wil also set the counter to 11 instead of 10, but 
; we are still counting 10 numbers it is just intentional
; the system will halt when counter is 0
; I am using 4 registers for my operations
; Register 3 will be our pointer register and contain the address of the numbers
; Register 4 will be the counter, and once the counter reaches 0 it stops
; Register 5 will be ths sum counter, containing the sum
; Register 6 will contain the numbers themselves to be checked




1110 011 000110001     ; Load the address x3131 in R3
0101 101 101 1 00000   ; Clear R5, this will be the sum
0001 100 101 1 01011   ; Adds 11 to R5 and store the value in R4, setting the counter to 11
0001 011 011 1 00001   ; Adds 1 to R3 to shift to the next address
0110 110 011 000000    ; Loads R6 with the value in the address in R3 
0001 100 100 1 11111   ; Subtract 1 from R4 to count down
0000 110 111111101     ; if value in R6 is positve, continue, else, go back 2 lines  
0001 101 110 000 101   ; Add R5 and R6 to store in R6  
0001 100 100 1 000000   ; Subtract 0 from R4 and store it in R4, this is to initiliaze R4 again
0000 101 111111010     ; if the value in R4 is 0, continue, else, go back 5 lines 
1111 0000 0010 0101    ; HALT
